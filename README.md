Hi! This is my streamlit app that is used to do Exploratory Data Analysis!

What are inside : 
1. Overview of the data frame
2. Statistics (Number of Rows, Number of Columns, Number of Categorical Variables, Number of Numerical Variables, Number of Boolean Variables)
3. For Numerical Variables : 
   1. 5 Number Summary (Max, Min, Q1, Median, Q3)
   2. Histogram (showing frequency of any numerical variable)
   3. Scatterplot (of any pair of numerical variables)
4. For Categorical Variables : 
   1. Table of Category Proportions
   2. Barplot (showing proportion of any categorical variable or categorical variable against numerical variable)


Instructions : 
1. Choose a file from your computer that you want to do analysis
2. If you want to have an overview of the data you uploaded, click "Show Data Frame"
3. Select Data Type from left side bar 
4. For Numerical Variables :
   1. Choose bin color
   2. Select Plot Type
      1. If choose Histogram
         1. Customize number of bins by dragging the bar
         2. Choose X-axis variable by selecting at the left side bar
      2. If choose Scatterplot
         1. Choose X-axis abd Y-axis variables at the left side bar
5. For Categorical Variables, customize your barplot by :
   1. Choose bin color
   2. Set Title
   3. Choose X-axis variable by either editing in the input widget or selecting at the left side bar
   4. Choose Y-axis variable by editing in the input widget

Note : 
1. NAs are dropped in order to calculate 5 number summaries for Numerical variables
